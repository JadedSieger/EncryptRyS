# EncryptRyS

EncryptRyS was an idea I had while programming Lieserl Einstein and Karelia-AI. A bot with a large variety of tools mainly focusing on making encryption, decryption, and other forms of tools accessible to the common discord user.

### Requirements
- latest version of node.js
- latest version of discord.js
- Visual Studio Code (Optional)

### Installation
1. Installing Dependecies

   -`npm i` or `npm i discord.js fs crypto`
3. Setting up Variables
 - Make your own `.env` file with the variables:
  - bot_token
  - prefix

### Note: an .env file must look like this;
```
prefix = prefix
bot_token = bot_token
guildId = guildID
clientId = clientID
```

This is incredibly helpful for making your projects secure, especially when using hosting, or ***uploading your random shenanigans on github*** *(Yes, I'm staring at myself.)*

4. Setting up

There should be no setting up required, just dive in with rys>help or your prefix of choice! 

### Initialization 
Running with an IDE is preferred. However, if you want to run from the Command Line, navigate to your target location with your copy of index.js with `cd <path>`, before running `node index.js`
